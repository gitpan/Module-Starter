        * Module::Starter::Plugin::Template added
        * module-starter now shows usage if no parms are passed.
        * The t/pod.t and t/pod-coverage.t files now use tainting,
          and require the appropriate versions of Test::Pod and
          Test::Pod::Coverage, respectively.

1.22    Mon Jul 12 17:05:26 CDT 2004

        [FIXES]
        * Another fix to inline POD, to cope with brain damage in Pod::Parser

1.20    Sun Jul 11 22:28:57 CDT 2004

        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        * Moved some data (distro, basedir) from parameters to object data
        * Moved some data (rtname) from routine-local to parameter data
        * Correted lies in POD regarding args to create_distro
        * Every create_file method now calls a file_guts method to get
          contents.
        * All the quoted POD inline should now not render in perldoc.
        * The module-build script now respects --class
        * Minor refactoring of parameters to create_directory and _module
        * Everything is now an overridable object method.  Thanks to
          Ricardo Signes.
        * Added verbose() method.
        * Added progress() method so subclass can decide how progress
          is reported.

        All of the above is courtesy the diligent work of Ricard Signes.

        [DOCUMENTATION]
        * Large expansion of POD (Starter.pm and module-starter)


1.00    Fri Jun 25 17:57:31 CDT 2004

        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        * Added a README file.  The README file is somewhat intelligently
          constructed, too.
        * Now you can specify both EU::MM and M::B as your builders,
          so the module can have a double life.

        Thanks to SÃ©bastien Aperghis-Tramonifor the help.
