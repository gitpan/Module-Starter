Revision history for Perl extension Module::Starter

1.01_01
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        * Everything is now an overridable object method.  Thanks to
          Ricardo Signes.
        * Added verbose() method.
        * Added progress() method so subclass can decide how progress
          is reported.

        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        * Added a README file.  The README file is somewhat intelligently
          constructed, too.
        * Now you can specify both EU::MM and M::B as your builders,
          so the module can have a double life.

        Thanks to SÃ©bastien Aperghis-Tramonifor the help.
